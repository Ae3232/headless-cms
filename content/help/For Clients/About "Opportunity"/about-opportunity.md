A few words about these two types of opportunities:<br><br>- The \"Project\" opportunity type is better suited for a large project with a large number of participants.<br>- The \"Job\" opportunity type is suitable for opening a position within the project or just for creating a one-time job.<br><br>You, as the Client, can invite Talents or Teams to work on your \"Project\" or \"Job\". Keep in mind that Talents and Teams can also apply to your opportunity by finding your project/job in a search."
